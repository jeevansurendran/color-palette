## Color - palette
This react project helps you store colors locally all the time. it uses local storage. This project uses [react-color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) to help with color picking and uses css modules to style the components.

### Question Statment

### Task
A color palette that allows users to select colors.

### Basics
The application should be a single page app with no need for navigation or routing.  On clicking the add (+) button, the user should be presented with a color picker interface to add color to a palette.

The color must be shown as a plain box with the Hex code, RGB and CMYK representations displayed below the box, as shown in the following mockup. Each color must have a label that can be edited by clicking on it. Each color box should display edit and delete controls upon mouse hover. The edit control will re-open the color picker interface while the delete control will remove the color from the palette.  

Whenever a new color is added to the palette or a change is made to one of the existing colors, the data needs to be stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, and must persist on refreshing the page.
